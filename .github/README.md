# ‚úÖ Getting started
**OpenCraft** is a game programmed in Java, it has the same motor (LWJGL 2 + Java 17) that Minecraft.

### Why this project? ü§î
> I created this project because Minecraft is closed-source. I know that you can decompile it, but modification
> and redistribution of a modified copy of Minecraft is actually illegal. So I created a clone of Minecraft that
> allows modification and redistribution.

I want to create a community around this project,
I hope that you can be part of that community forking the repository or simply, bring us a star :heart:
